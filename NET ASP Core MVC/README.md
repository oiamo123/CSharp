# Welcome to Inland Marina üëã

> This project was developed as an assignment for class. The purpose of the project was to familiarize ourselves with Microsoft Entity and a database first approach. Some of the projects goals include allowing users to sign in, sign out as well as book docking slips for boats. For authentication and authorization we were taught cookies however I familiarized myself with Microsft Identity.
>
> The project has two folders, InlandMarina which holds the views and controllers and InlandMarinaData for the models and database context file. There's also functionality for administrators which would allow an admin to remove, add and update slips which can be found within &#34;Areas&#34; along with all of the Customer functionality like booking and removing slips using Entity.
